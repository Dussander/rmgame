Rick and Morty Text Adventure in Python
Created while doing the exercises in Learning Python the Hardway.
From the Python2 version of the book.  I had to convert my scripts to 
Python3 and figure out the web changes using Flask.  

# app.py
If you run app.py from the root, it will launch a flask based web server for the game.
Figure out the ip to play from a web browser.  Adjust secret_key, host, and port accordingly.

# console.py
Use this to play from a terminal locally

# test
These probably don't work, I haven't updated them
